## fibre

- used in UI updation
- it increase the suitability of animation, layout and gesture
- other features are:

1. Pause a work and come back later
2. assign priority to diferent types of work
   (like when there are multiple updation operation than it assigns priority to operation which one is need to do first)
3. reuse previously completed work
4. abort work if it is no longer needed
   (like there may be cases where we three consecutive updates on a button then it will abort the initially update and do the final update.)

- in order to do any of the above, we first need a way to break work down into units.In one sense, that's what a fiber is.
- Therefore a fiber represents a unit of work

## What is reconciliation?

- reconciliation: The algorithm React uses to diff one tree with another to determine which parts need to be changed.

- Actually re-rendering the entire app on each change only works for the most trivial apps; in a real-world app, it's prohibitively costly in terms of performance. React has optimizations which create the appearance of whole app re-rendering while maintaining great performance. The bulk of these optimizations are part of a process called reconciliation.

- Reconciliation is the algorithm behind what is popularly understood as the "virtual DOM." A high-level description goes something like this: when you render a React application, a tree of nodes that describes the app is generated and saved in memory. This tree is then flushed to the rendering environment â€” for example, in the case of a browser application, it's translated to a set of DOM operations. When the app is updated (usually via setState), a new tree is generated. The new tree is diffed with the previous tree to compute which operations are needed to update the rendered app.

## The key points are:

- Different component types are assumed to generate substantially different trees. React will not attempt to diff them, but rather replace the old tree completely.

- Diffing of lists is performed using keys. Keys should be "stable, predictable, and unique."
