# useCallback

useCallback is a React Hook that lets you cache a function definition between re-renders.

```
const cachedFn = useCallback(fn, dependencies)
```

- dependencies is an array we have to pass the variable which changeing wehnever we do something
- useEffect()
- useRef() : used to take ref like if we want to copy something then we use it
